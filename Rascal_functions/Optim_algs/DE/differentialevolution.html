Preamble
</font></h3>

I have put a lot of effort into this contribution to Matlab Central. As I 
used the code successfully for myself for quite some time, I am sure that it can 
be rather valuable for the one or the other. If you find any errors or bugs, 
if you have problems in using the function or if you find the documentation 
insufficiently detailed:

<h3><font color="#000080">Introduction
</font></h3>

This contribution provides functions for finding an optimum parameter set 
using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm">
Evolutionary Algorithm</a> of <b>Differential Evolution</b>. Simply 
speaking: If you have some complicated function of which you are unable to 
compute a derivative, and you want to find the parameter set minimizing the 
output of the function, using this package is one possible way to go.<br><br>

The core of the optimization is the Differential Evolution algorithm. For an 
introduction to the algorithm, see the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html#basi">
basics section</a> on the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html">
<b>Differential Evolution homepage</b></a> of Rainer Storn. You will also find a demo 
applet and code for different programming languages there. For in-depth documentation and 
publications, check out the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/litera.html">
Literature Section</a>. Even several <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html#link">
books about Differential Evolution</a> are available.<br><br>

This package provides much more than the code available on the referenced 
homepage. Here is a list of some features:

<ul>
	<li>Optimization can run in parallel on multiple cores/computers.
	<li>Extensive and configurable progress information during optimization.
	<li>Intermediate results are stored for later review of optimization progress.
	<li>Progress information can be sent by E-mail.
	<li>Optimization toolbox is not needed.
	<li>Quick start with demo functions.
	<li>Intermediate results are displayed after the optimization.
	<li>Different end conditions can be chosen (maximum time, value to reach etc.).
	<li>Each parameter value can be constrained to an interval.
	<li>Each parameter value can be quantized (for example for parameters of integer nature).
	<li>Code can easily be extended to use the evolutionary algorithm of your choice.
</ul>

I have developed this package for an own project. A single evaluation of my 
objective function took between 30 seconds and one minute and the parameter 
space was galactically large. If your objective function needs only milliseconds to 
evaluate and your optimization is expected to finish in seconds or minutes, 
you can still use this package. However, much of its power (parallel processing, 
progress notifications) will not be of much use.<br><br>

In addition to this documentation, I have summarized E-mail conversations in 
a list of <a href="differentialevolution-faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions.</a>

<h3><font color="#000080">Quick start
</font></h3>

To get into the usage of the package quickly, check out the demo functions 
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">demo1.m</font>,
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">demo2.m</font> and 
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">demo3.m</font>. Modify those files 
to start your first optimization. Essentially you only have to define 
which parameters to optimize and provide a handle to your objective function. 
You can learn about everything else later.

Your objective function can be called in different ways:
<ul>
	<li>With a scalar or column vector as the only input argument.
	<li>With a structure containing the current parameters as only input argument.
	<li>With one or more fixed arguments first, then a parameter vector or structure as last argument.
</ul>
If your objective function has an argument list that does not comply with 
one of these possibilities, you have to write a small wrapper function which 
brings the arguments into the correct order and calls your objective function. 
In any case, your objective function has to return a <b>finite scalar</b> 
(not NaN or Inf) as the first output argument.<br><br>

The definition of the parameters to optimize is expected as a cell array. The 
first column of the cell array has to contain the parameter names. In the second 
column, you have to provide the parameter ranges. For a scalar parameter, the 
range is expected as a two-element row vector. For vector-valued parameters, you 
have to give the ranges of the elements as a two-column matrix with ranges in 
rows. The third column contains the parameter quantization steps as a 
scalar or a column vector (set to zero for no quantization). The fourth column 
(optional) can contain the initial values of the parameters. If your objective 
function shall be called with a column parameter vector instead of a structure 
as input, define only one single parameter with an empty string as parameter name. 
See the help text (&quot;help differentialevolution&quot;) and the demos for 
more details and examples.<br><br>

<h3><font color="#000080">Parallel processing on multiple cores
</font></h3>
This package allows to work in parallel on multiple cores in order to increase 
the speed of the optimization. One process acts as the master and all other 
processes act as slaves. The only requirements for parallel processing are:
<ul>
	<li>All involved processes have to have read- and write-access to a common directory, 
	for example on a network share.
	<li>All involved processes have to have access to identical code versions of the 
	objective function.
</ul>
For parallel processing, the main function differentialevolution.m has to be started in 
one Matlab process. In all other processes, the function differentialevolutionslave.m 
has to be started. The master process will save files including the parameter 
sets to evaluate into the common directory. 
The slave processes load the parameter files, evaluate the objective function and 
save the obtainted results into other files. After each iteration, the master process 
collects the evaluated results and feeds the slave processes with data files 
again. If there are no results found, the master process will evaluate the 
parameter sets himself. This way, the slaves can never cause the master to 
get stuck.<br><br>

The <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=13775&objectType=file">
Multicore package</a> on Matlab Central actually emanated from this function 
and works quite similar. 

<h3><font color="#000080">Functions contained in this package
</font></h3>
In the following, the most important functions contained in this package are 
listed. Every file contains its own help comments which you can access by 
typing &quot;help functionname&quot; on the Matlab command line.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">differentialevolution.m
</font></b><br>
The main function to call after preparing the input arguments.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">getdefaultparams.m
</font></b><br>
When starting to work with this package, you probably do not want to handle 
with every existing parameter for function differentialevolution.m. You can 
get a default parameter set by calling getdefaultparams.m.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">differentialevolutionslave.m
</font></b><br>
When working in parallel on multiple cores/computers, this 
function has to be started in every Matlab process that shall act as slave. 

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">computenewpopulation.m
</font></b><br>
The core Differential Evolution algorithm resides in this functions. If you 
like to use your own favorite evolutionary algorithm, you can put the code 
into this function.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">demo1.m, demo2.m, demo3.m
</font></b><br>
Demo functions you can modify for a quick start.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">foxholes.m, rosenbrocksaddle.m
</font></b><br>
These two functions are used for the demos. They implement two functions that 
are often cited in the context of optimization algorithms (&quot;Shekel's 
Foxholes&quot; and &quot;Rosenbrock's Saddle&quot;). 

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">deletewithsemaphores.m, setfilesemaphore.m
</font></b><br>
These functions help to avoid simultaneous file access when working with 
multiple cores. 

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">sendmailblat.m
</font></b><br>
Function sendmailblat.m sends E-mail notifications using the freeware 
executable blat.exe on Windows (file may no longer be included in this package, 
see the <a href="http://www.blat.net/">Blat homepage</a> for download and more 
information). There are alternatives for sending E-mails from Matlab on Windows, 
but I don't see any need to change this.

<br><br><b><font color="#000080">existfile.m, existfile.c</font></b><br>
Test if a file exists. To use the faster mex-file, type 
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">&quot;mex -setup&quot;</font>, 
select the builtin Lcc compiler and type
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">&quot;mex existfile.c&quot;</font>
to compile the file. However, the package also works without using the mex-file.

Problems/open issues
</font></h3>  

<b>Vector parameters</b><br><br>
In my own project, I always passed the current parameter set as a structure 
to my objective function. Each field contained a scalar parameter value. 
Before releasing this package on Matlab Central, I introduced the possibility to 
work with vector-valued parameters, either passed as a single column vector or as 
a structure with vector-valued fields to the objective function. However, I did 
not have the time to test vector-valued parameters extensively. If you find 
any bugs with this, please let me know.

<br><br><b>Parameter quantization</b><br><br>
The original Differential Evolution algorithm only know unbounded, continuous 
parameters. In order to include parameters of integer nature into the optimization, 
I have extended the algorithm in this way. Internally, all parameters are 
continuous. Only before passing them to the objective function, the parameter 
values are quantized.

<br><br><b>Hard parameter bounds</b><br><br>
In my own project, and I guess in most other optimization problems as well, 
I always had an idea about the possible range for each optimal parameter. A hard
parameter range has to be given here for every parameter. Using -Inf or Inf as 
lower or upper bound is <b>not</b> possible. A side effect of the hard bounds 
is that parameter sets including boundary values can be evaluated with higher 
probability under certain circumstances.

<br><br><b>Breaking using Ctrl-C</b><br><br>
When breaking the optimization using Ctrl-C, it might happen that you catch 
Matlab just when writing to a file. When you start the optimization again and 
the same file needs to be accessed again, the file is locked until you quit 
and restart Matlab (at least on Windows). To avoid this, a 'time-over'-file 
is saved in the current directory. After each function evaluation, the master 
process checks if the file is still existing. If it was deleted, the 
optimization is finished cheerfully.

<br><br><b>Shrinking slave support in parallel processing</b><br><br>
When processing in parallel, the master process feeds the slaves at the start 
of each iteration and collects the results at the end. Further, as all parameter 
sets that have been evaluated before are saved, not all parameter vectors in 
the current population might need to be evaluated. If the population has already 
converged very well, it can happen that there are less new parameter vectors 
in the population than processes are working on the optimization problem. In 
this case, some or all slaves are sleeping, as there is no more work to do.

<br><br><b>Parameter vectors in rows and columns</b><br><br>
I always save parameter vectors as column vectors. However, the core 
Differential Evolution algorithm taken from the 
<a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/code.html#matl">Differential 
Evolution homepage</a> expects parameter vectors to be stored in rows. 
Unfortunately, the code now contains a mixture of representations as rows 
and columns. You will never get involved with this issue until you edit the 
code. Parameter vectors are passed to your objective functions as column vectors. 
If your objective function needs to get parameter vectors passed as row vectors, 
you will have to write a small wrapper function that transposed the vectors 
and calls the objective function in the right way.
